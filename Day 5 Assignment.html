        <p>A simple number guessing game is played between the computer and one player. The algorithm follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Determine a secret number in a range </li>
          <li> Prompt the player for a number in that range </li>
          <li> Compare the player’s number to the secret number. </li>
          <li> If the player’s number matches the secret number, then display a "You won!" message. </li>
          <li> Otherwise display a "hint" message - this must be the result of a method call! </li>
        </ul>

                <p>Extra Challenge!!<br />An 'upgraded' version of this game involves guessing a word instead - the computer selects a word from a list and the user must guess the word. The program
                  should communicate the category that the words belong to. The algorithm follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Determine a secret word from a list of words </li>
                  <li> Prompt the player for a word from a category </li>
                  <li> Compare the player’s word to the secret word. </li>
                  <li> If the player’s word matches the secret word, then display a "You won!" message. </li>
                  <li> Otherwise display a "hint" message - this must be the result of a method call! </li>

                  <li> Modify the <b>GuessingGame</b> application to let the user choose the type of game they wish to play. <br />
                    Your program must <b>overload</b> the <tt>giveHint()</tt> method to work with either numbers or words.<br />
                    Display the hint from your <tt>main()</tt> method. The application output should look similar to:
