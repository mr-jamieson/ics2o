      <h4>Why Program in Java?</h4>
      <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. <em>Object-Oriented Programming</em> (OOP) evolved out of the need to develop complex programs in a systematic, modular
        approach.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OOP programmers create modules, called <strong>classes</strong> that can be used over and over in a variety of programs</li>
        <li>A class groups related data and the instructions for performing actions on that data</li>
        <li>The Java Platform runs on <strong>all major operating systems</strong> allowing Java applications to run on just about any computer (known as <em>platform-independent
            applications</em>)</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Objects, Classes, Packages &amp; Applications</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>OOP development involves selecting objects to perform tasks outlined in program specification</li>
        <li>An object consists of:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Related data</li>
          <li>Instructions for performing actions on that data</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A class</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Defines the type of data and actions that will be associated with an object of that class (but not the actual data for an individual object)</li>
          <li>Is required to create objects</li>
          <li>A class can be used to create many objects &ndash; each object will have the same type of data and possible actions, but each object maintains its own set of data.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

          data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A package (sometimes called a library) is a group of related classes</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Here is an illustration of a DVD class and a CD class put into a Media Package:</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

          style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Java Application is a package with at least one class that contains a <strong>main()</strong> method.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><img src="images/A1Application.jpg" alt="Package containing a Java Application" title="Package containing a Java Application"
          style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Classes are importable - an application can use existing classes from another package by using the <strong>import</strong> keyword</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Your First Java Application</h4>
      <p>The following HelloWorld application is a simple, yet complete, Java program:</p>

      <h5>The Parts of a Java Application</h5>
      <h6>Statements</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>The set of instructions that make up the program</li>
        <li>Each statement ends with a semi-colon ;</li>
        <li>Related statements are enclosed in a curly bracket {}</li>
        <li>In our application the statements are</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">package activity1;</span></li>
          <ul>
            <li>declares a package name, if undeclared it will be <strong>default</strong>.</li>
            <li>not usually included in simple applications</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">import simpleIO.*;</span></li>
          <ul>
            <li>makes available a Utility class, <strong>Console</strong>, to simplfy the process of obtaining user input and output</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">public class HelloWorld</span></li>
          <ul>
            <li>class declaration</li>
            <li>the class is available to everyone (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">public</span>)</li>
            <li>it is called HelloWorld, and contained in a file named "<strong>HelloWorld.java</strong>"</li>
            <li>no objects or actions are defined by the class (we will get to this later)</li>
            <li>it does contain a main method (which is where the program will start)</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">public static void main(String[] args)</span></li>
          <ul>
            <li>defines the <strong>main</strong> method</li>
            <li>a method is a named set of statements that perform a single, well-defined task</li>
            <li>the method is available to everyone (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">public</span>)</li>
            <li>it is a class method - doesn't need an object to be created to use it (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">static</span>)</li>
            <li>it returns no value (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">void</span>)</li>
            <li>it can optionally accept a list of words as command-line arguments (<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">String[] args</span>)</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">Console.<em>print</em>("Hello World");</span></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Uses the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;">print()</span> method of the <strong>Console</strong> class to write text to the standard
              output.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      </ul>
      <h6>Comments</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Comments provide information about the program to the reader of the code</li>
        <li>Comments have no effect on how the program runs</li>
        <li>Allow the reader to quickly understand the purpose and logic behind segments of code</li>
        <li>Complex applications are often developed and maintained by more than one programmer, properly commented code allows for easier modifications and can decrease the number
          of mistakes</li>
        <li>Java programs can contain three types of comments:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif; color: #6aa84f;"><strong>/* */</strong></span></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Enclose single or multi line comments at the beginning of a program to describe the application or inside to clarify a segment of code</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif; color: #6aa84f;"><strong>//</strong></span></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Used for adding a comment to a specific statement or for a single line comment -- Useful for debugging</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif; color: #597eaa;"><strong>/** */</strong></span></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Used for documentation</li>
            <li>The javadoc tool copies these comments into a separate HTML document to create an instruction manual or external documentation</li>
            <li>These are appropriate for describing a class or method</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>

              <p><strong>Code conventions</strong> are a set of guidelines for writing an application. They provide details about commenting, rules for naming methods, classes, and
                packages, and statement formatting. They make programs easier to read and understand. Organizations that employ programmers often not only encourage the use of code
                conventions, but require it.</p>
              <p>Through this course, code conventions will be introduced as needed. It is important that you pay attention to these conventions and use them when you write your
                code.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A Program Header should begin a program.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The comment should include information such as your name, class name, the date, and a brief statement about the program</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Package names should begin with a lowercase letter and then an uppercase letter should begin each word within the name, no spaces!</li>
                <li>Class names should be nouns and begin with an uppercase letter and an uppercase letter should begin each word within the name, no spaces!</li>
                <li>A comment block should be included before each class and method.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Not typically placed before the main() method</li>
                </ul>
                <li>An open curly brace <strong>{</strong> should be placed on the same line as the class or method declaration, and the closing curly brace <strong>}</strong>
                  should be on a separate line and aligned with the class or method declaration</li>

      <h4>Variables</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a name for a value stored in memory</li>
        <li>Variables are used in programs so that values can be represented with meaningful names</li>
        <li>Variables should be used to represent values because they make code easier to read, understand and modify</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Declaring Variables</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Declaration</strong>: A variable must be declared before it is used. This is the form:</li>
      </ul>
      <pre style="padding-left: 60px;">&lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt;</pre>
      <p style="padding-left: 60px;">&lt;type&gt; is the data type (determines the type of data the variable will store)<br />&lt;name&gt; is the identifier (the variable name
        &ndash; should be descriptive)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To declare a variable named <strong>length</strong> that will hold an integer (positive or negative whole number), you would type:</li>
      </ul>
      <pre style="padding-left: 60px;">int length;</pre>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple variables with the same type can be declared in a single statement, similar to:</li>
      </ul>
      <pre style="padding-left: 60px;">int length, width;</pre>
      <h5>Using Variables</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Applications typically contain many variables, to hold values that are needed for calculations, and the results of those calculations:</li>
      </ul>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 1: The RectangleArea program</h4>

      <p>Consider the following program in Java:</p>
      <pre class="code">import simpleIO.*;

/**
* Calculates and displays the area of a rectangle.
*/

public class RectangleArea {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    //Variable Declaration and Initialization
    int length = 10, width = 2;
    int area;

    //Processing: Use area formula
    area = length * width;

    //Output the calculated area
    Console.print("Area of rectangle: " + area);
  }
}</pre>
  <p>Some important terminology to note:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assignment</strong>: an assignment statement is formed with the variable name on the left and the value on the right of an equal sign. The value on the right can be a literal (actual value, ie. 5), or another variable or expression (ie. length*width)</li>
        <li><strong>Initialization</strong>: An assignment statement can be part of a variable declaration. In this case, the variable is initialized. For instance, length and width were both initialized (assigned values) when they were declared.</li>
        <li><strong>Concatenation</strong>: To append, or concatenate, the value of a variable to a String, the <b>+</b> operator is used. The result is then passed into the <tt>Console.print()</tt> statement for the user to read. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>It is important to realize that a variable can store only one value at any one time</strong>. For example, after the following statements execute:</p>
      <pre style="padding-left: 60px;">int x;
x = 5;
x = 10;</pre>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">the value of x is 10, because this was the last value assigned.</p>

      <h4>Constants</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A constant is a name for a memory location that stores a value that cannot be changed from its initial assignment</li>
        <li>Using constants is considered good programming style</li>
        <li>Use the keyword <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, sans-serif;"><strong>final</strong> </span>to define a constant,&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <pre style="padding-left: 60px;">final int SCREEN_WIDTH = 800;
final double PI = 3.14159265358979;</pre>
      <ul>
        <li>A constant can be assigned a value only once</li>
      </ul>
      <table class="didyouknow">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th><img src="../resources/images/tips.gif"  /></th>
            <td>
              <p><b>Naming Variables &amp; Constants</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Variable &amp; constant names <strong>must</strong> begin with a letter, and may contain letters, numbers, _, and&nbsp;$</li>
                <li>Begin variable names with a lowercase letter, and then an uppercase letter should begin each word within the name, no spaces!</li>
                <li>Constant names should be all uppercase with an underscore between words if necessary</li>
                <li><em>Don't</em> use the same variable name with different cases.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>For example, lastname and lastName are considered to be two different variables in Java because of the fact the letter &ldquo;N&rdquo; is in a different
                    case.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <li><em>Don't</em> use&nbsp;reserved words and keywords (they will turn into a different colour if you type them in) of the Java language.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Examples of reserved or keywords in Java are: <strong>if, else, do, while, continue, break, case, switch, void, null</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Grouping variables together in a single statement is good programming style as long as variables represent related items, not just because they happen to be the
                  same type.</li>
                <li>Group all variable declarations at the beginning of a method. Follow the declarations with a single blank line.</li>
                <li>Constant declarations should be grouped at the beginning of a method <strong>before</strong> any variable declarations</li>
              </ul>

      <h4>Data Types</h4>

      <p>Data types describe the kind of data a variable or constant can store. Java provides built-in data types, but you can also define your own data types by using classes.</p>

      <p>Simple or <strong>primitive data types</strong> represent a single piece of information, for example, a single number or a single sequence of text. Working with primitive
        values is usually faster than working with complex values, because<em> Java</em> stores primitive values in a special way that makes memory and speed optimizations
        possible.</p>

          <li>Both the compiler and reader will understand the possible values for a variable</li>
          <li>The compiler allocates the appropriate memory for the variable</li>

      </ul>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 2: Precision of Floating-Point Numbers</h4>

      <p>Both <code>double</code> and <code>float</code> are considered floating point numbers. Consider the following code that calculates a number by squaring its square root.
        The difference in these values is due to the rounding error in Java.</p>

      <pre class="code">
    Console.print(&quot;Double Precision:&quot;);
    double num = 2.0;
    double sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(num);
    double square = sqrtNum * sqrtNum;

    Console.print("Original number: " + num);
    Console.print("After Calculation: " + square);
    Console.print("Error: " + (square - num));
      </pre>

      <p>Run the program to see the limitations of using floating-point numbers.</p>



      <h4>Strings: Compound Data Types</h4>

      <p>Strings are comprised of a set of characters, and therefore cannot be represented by a primitive data type. They are instead considered Compound, or Abstract Data Types
        (ADTs). String variables are actually instances of the
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target=_blank>String</a> class (defined in the java.lang package), although we rarely declare them
        as such. Wrapper classes (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html" target=_blank>Integer</a>, <a
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html" target=_blank>Double</a>, <a
          href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Boolean.html" target=_blank>Boolean</a>, etc) are also considered ADTs.</p>

      <p>The following statements are equivalent in Java:</p>

      <pre class=code>String course = "Computer Science";</pre>

      <pre class=code>String course = new String("Computer Science");</pre>


      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <h4>User Input</h4>

      <p>Just as a computer incorporates the input-processing-storage-output model, individual programs incorporate this model as well. The programs we have written so far have
        begun with some values (the input), have made calculations (the processing), have kept track of the results (the temporary storage) and have sent the processed data to the
        screen (the output). The only problem we have with these programs is that the input can&#39;t be easily changed; the values of each variable are always going to be what the
        programmer assigned them to be.</p>

      <p>The user is the person using the computer program and the user needs to interact with the program in order to make the program useful. When programming, the programmer
        must realize that s/he is not the user of the program. The user is the person who interacts with the program for his/her own use. In order for the program to be useful,
        there must be a way for the user to interact with the program.</p>

      <p>There are several ways to interact with a program, like clicking the mouse on certain parts of the program or entering information using the keyboard. In the last two
        activities, you have created programs that did not require the user to interact with the program at all. In this activity, you will have the user interact with the program
        by inputting information into it by using the keyboard.</p>

      <h5>The Console Class</h5>

      <p>As seen in Activity 1, a <strong>Console </strong>class has been provided in the <strong>simpleIO </strong>package to make the process of outputting information to the
        screen easier for the beginning programmer. In addition to providing methods that output information to the Console, there are also methods provided that allow the
        programmer to obtain <strong>user input </strong>as well.</p>

      <p><em>It is important to note that this class is NOT included in the standard Java library; it was created by your teacher to make your life easier! By the end of the
          course, you should be able to create your own Input/Output class, with the methods that you would find useful in your programs.</em></p>

      <p>To view a full list and explanations of the methods provided by the Console class, a special document, call the JavaDoc, has been created for your reference.&nbsp; Note
        that this document was created automatically, simply by using the documentation comments as method headers in the <strong>Console.java</strong> file.</p>

      <table class="externallink">
        <tbody>

            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The four methods that will allow you to obtain input from the user are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>Console.readString(String prompt)</tt></li>
        <li><tt>Console.readInt(String prompt)</tt></li>
        <li><tt>Console.readDouble(String prompt)</tt></li>
        <li><tt>Console.readChar(String prompt)</tt></li>
      </ul>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 3: Obtaining input from the User</h4>

      <p>Below are some examples of how you might use each input method in a program:</p>

      <pre class=code>
String name = Console.readString("What is your name?");

int age = Console.readInt("How old are you?");

double price = Console.readDouble("How much is that doggy in the window?");

char userContinue = Console.readChar("Do you want to continue? Y/N")</pre>

      <p>All of these methods <strong>return a value</strong>; this means that writing them on their own will not do much, you must do something with the value, such as storing it in a variable of the required type. The <strong>prompt</strong> that you must write should be a short message to the user indicating what sort of value you are expecting from them.</p>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 4: The RectangleArea program, revisited</h4>

      <p>Below is a simple example of the <strong>readInt</strong> method being used:</p>

      <pre class="code">
import simpleIO.*;

/**
* Calculates and displays the area of a rectangle.
*/

public class RectangleArea {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    //Variable Declaration
    int length, width, area;

    //Program Description
    Console.print(&quot;This program will determine the area of a rectangle&quot;);

    //Input
    length = Console.readInt(&quot;Enter the length of the rectangle&quot;);
    width = Console.readInt(&quot;Enter the width of the rectangle&quot;);

    //Processing
    area = length * width;

    //Output
    Console.print(&quot;The area of rectangle entered is: &quot; + area + &quot; square units&quot;);
  }
}</pre>

      <p>Notice that the Console.readInt(&quot;...&quot;) part of the code is on the <strong>right side </strong>of an <strong>assignment statement</strong>. This will initialize the variable (give it a value) to the number that the user types in.&nbsp; Unlike the Console.print(&quot;...&quot;) method, you would rarely ever see this method used on its own, without being assigned to a variable, used in a calculation or as an input to another method.</p>

        <li>You can alter the order of operations by using parentheses as in math!</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ex) 6 + 4 * 2 &ndash; 1 evaluates to 13</li>
          <li>Ex) (6+4) * (2-1) evaluates to 10</li>
        </ul>
        <li>It is considered good programming style to include brackets where there is any possibility of ambiguity or question about the expression</li>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 7: Determining the Date of Easter</h4>

      <p>The date of Easter Sunday can vary widely from year to year. The Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 decreed that Easter Sunday was to be held on the first Sunday following the
        full moon that occurred on or after the first day of spring. Because the date depends on solar, lunar, and calendar cycles, it is not easy to find an arithmetic procedure
        that will determine the correct date for any given year.</p>

      <p>The first such procedure was determined in 1876; an adaptation of that procedure is given below. It involves a sequence of divisions that start with the year, and
        eventually produce a month number (3 for March, 4 for April) and the day of the month.</p>
      <img src="images/A1EasterCalculation1.jpg" />
      <p>The Java implementation of the algorithm is shown below</p>

      <pre class="code">
// a - m - the quotients and remainders needed
int a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, m, p;
int month; // Easter month
int day; // Easter day
int year; // Easter&#39;s year

// Prompt user for year
year = Console.readInt(&quot;Easter Date Calculator\nPlease enter a year&quot;);

// Calculations
a = year % 19;
b = year / 100;
c = year % 100;
d = b / 4;
e = b % 4;
f = (8 + b) / 25;
g = (b - f + 1) / 3;
h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) % 30;
i = c / 4;
k = c % 4;
j = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) % 7;
m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * j) / 451;
month = (h + j - 7 * m + 114) / 31;
p = (h + j - 7 * m + 114) % 31;
day = p + 1;

Console.print(&quot;Easter will fall on Sunday, &quot; + year + &quot;-&quot; + month + &quot;-&quot; + day);

      <h4>Assignment Operators</h4>

      <p>In an assignment statement, the expression on the right side of the equal sign is evaluated first, and then that value is given to the variable on the left side. It is
        possible to use the current value of the variable in the expression itself</p>

      <pre>
counter = 12;		//counter is assigned 12
counter = counter + 2;	//counter is now 14</pre>

      <p>Changing the value of a variable based on its current value is common, so there is a shortcut. Java recognizes =, and also +=, -=, *=, /=, and %= assignment operators</p>

      <pre>
counter += 2;		//same as 2nd statement above</pre>

      <p>The following table shows a few examples of the assignment operator:</p>

      <h4>Increment / Decrement operators</h4>

      <p>A common task for programmers is to have a variable that either counts up or counts down. To further simplify this process, Java offers two unary operators that will
        increment or decrement the value that is stored in a variable.</p>

      <h4>Type Conversion</h4>

      <p>A <strong>type conversion</strong> occurs when a value is changed into a value of a different data but compatible type.</p>


      <p><strong>Automatic Conversion (Coercion)</strong></p>

            </th>
            <td>
              <p><strong>Automatic conversion</strong> (also called Implicit Conversion) is performed by <em>Java</em> at run time. For example, when a value of a 'smaller' numeric
                type is assigned to a variable of a 'larger' numeric type, the numeric types are implicitly converted. This is also referred to as 'widening' type conversion. The
                following picture illustrates widening conversion:</p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><strong>Explicit Conversion (Casting)</strong></p>

      <p>A programmer can use program code to tell the compiler to treat a variable of one data type as if it belongs to a different data type. You do this by enclosing the new
        type in parentheses and placing the name of the variable after the parentheses.</p>

              <p>Explicit casting is required when you are assigning a value of 'larger' data type to a 'smaller' data type. This is also referred to as 'narrowing' type
                conversion. The following picture illustrates narrowing conversion:</p>

              <p>While it is possible to convert Strings to other data types, you cannot use a casting operator to do this. Instead, you will make use of conversion methods

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 8: Explicit vs Implicit Conversion</h4>

      <p>A common task for programmers is to convert your <strong>double</strong> data types to <strong>int</strong> or <strong>long</strong>, or to convert your
        <strong>int</strong> or <strong>long</strong> data types to <strong>double</strong>. This can be accomplished in a number of ways.</p>
      <table width="95%" cellpadding="6" summary="This table is for formatting purposes." cellspacing="0" class="CenterTable"
        style="border-left: 1px solid #000; border-bottom: 1px solid #000;">


        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #000; border-left: none; border-bottom: none;"><strong>double</strong> to <strong>int</strong> or
              <strong>long</strong> <br /><br /> (Explicit Conversion)</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #000; border-left: none; border-bottom: none;">
              <ol>
                <li>If you have a value stored in a variable declared as type <strong>double</strong>, you can assign it to a variable of type <strong>int</strong> or
                  <strong>long</strong>, but you will need to <strong>cast</strong> the variable from a double to an int.<br />Observe the following code:</li>
              </ol>
              <pre class="code">double num = 5.93323;
int i;
i = num;
Console.print("i = " + i);</pre>

              <p>This will cause an <strong>error</strong> since there is a <strong>possible loss of precision</strong>. Modify the code as follows:</p>
              <pre class=code>i = (int)num;</pre>

              <p>Now the code works! Notice that it doesn't round the decimals; it simply <strong>truncates</strong>. Explicit conversion can result in a loss of precision!</p>

              <ol start="2">
                <li>If you wish to round the <strong>double</strong> variable when you assign it to the <strong>int</strong> or <strong>long</strong> variable, you can use the
                  Math.round method.<br />Observe the following code:</li>
              </ol>
              <pre class="code">double num = 5.93323;
int i;
i = Math.round(num);
Console.print("i = " + i);</pre>

              <p>This will not work since the rounding function for a double returns a LONG not an INT. Modify the code as follows:</p>
              <pre class=code>i = (int)Math.round(num);</pre>

      <h4>Rounding Numbers in Java</h4>

      <p>When working with floating point numbers, there is often a need to round the final answer before outputting the value to the user. There are a few different options to do this.</p>

      <p>Option 1: Using <tt>Math.round()</tt>. This function will return an <tt>int</tt> or a <tt>long</tt> value that is rounded to the nearest whole number. You can use a combination of multiplication and division by powers of 10 to round to a certain number of decimal places.</p>

      <p>Option 2: Use the methods in the Console class to format your values as you output them to the user. This will not change the value stored in memory, but affect how it is displayed.</p>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 9: Rounding in Java - using Math.round()</h4>

      <p>The Math.round() function always rounds to the nearest whole number. See below for a reminder about rounding rules:</p>

      <pre class="code">
    long answer1;
    double answer2;

    //Rounding to a whole number
    answer1 = Math.round(204.999);
    Console.print(answer1); // displays 205
    answer1 = Math.round(204.499);
    Console.print(answer1); // displays 204

    //Rounding to a tenth
    answer2 = Math.round(204.999 * 10) / 10.0;
    Console.print(answer2); // displays 205.0
    answer2 = Math.round(204.499 * 10) / 10.0;
    Console.print(answer2); // displays 204.5
  </pre>


        <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 10: Rounding in Java - using the Console class</h4>

        <p>The Console class has a few options for rounding numbers before they are displayed to the user:</p>

        <pre class="code">
    //Rounding to a whole number
    Console.print(204.999, 0);  // displays 205
    Console.print(204.499, 0);  // displays 204

    //Rounding to a tenth
    Console.print(204.999, 1);  // displays 205.0
    Console.print(204.499, 1);  // displays 204.5

    //Rounding within a String using roundDouble()
    Console.print("The answer is: " + Console.roundDouble(204.499, 1));  // displays "The answer is: 204.5"
    </pre>
