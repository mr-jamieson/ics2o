      <h4>Algorithm Design</h4>

      <p>An <b>algorithm</b> is a set of steps for solving a particular problem. To be an algorithm, a set of rules must be unambiguous and have a clear stopping point. We use
        algorithms every day; for example, a recipe for baking a cake is an algorithm. Most computer programs consist of algorithms. One of the key challenges in programming is
        inventing algorithms that are simple, requiring the fewest steps possible.</p>

      <p>Flowcharts are used to communicate algorithms in language-independent terms. A flowchart is a diagram using symbols and arrows which describes the solution to a computer
        problem in a step-by-step manner.</p>

      <p>The first thing you need is a set of symbols you can use so that your flowcharts make sense and look organized.</p>

      <h6>Flowcharting Rules</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Each symbol has one entry and one exit point except Decision (one entry and two exits) and Terminator (one entry or one exit only).</li>
        <li>Each arrow connects to each symbol or arrow.</li>
        <li>Arrows do not cross.</li>
        <li>Yes/no responses should face the same direction for each decision symbol. </li>
        <li>All lines and symbols are drawn neatly and with precision. </li>
        <li>Best Practice: have one start and one stop.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Boolean or Logical Expressions</h4>

      <p>In programming, decisions are made based on conditions. A <strong>condition </strong>takes the form of a boolean expression (sometimes called a logical expression). Every
        boolean expression has
        one of the two boolean values: <strong>true </strong>or <strong>false</strong>.</p>

      <p>Boolean expressions can be created in the following ways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>boolean variables (can be assigned a value of true or false)</li>
        <li>comparison (or relational) operators</li>
        <li>boolean operators</li>
      </ul>


      <h5>Comparison Operators</h5>

      <p>Comparison (or relational) operators test a relationship between two values and determine if the relationship is <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.</p>

          <tr>
            <th>Operator</th>
            <th>Relationship Tested</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>==</td>
            <td>Equal to</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>!=</td>
            <td>Not equal to</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;</td>
            <td>Less than</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&gt;</td>
            <td>Greater than</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;=</td>
            <td>Less than or equal to</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&gt;=</td>
            <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>


      <p>By comparing two values or expressions, you test that a relationship (such as "less than") exists between them. If the relationship does exist, the condition is true; if
        not, it is false. These are the relationships you can test in Java.</p>

      <p>You can use relational operators to compare variables, constants and the values of arithmetic expressions. The following table shows the results of using the relational
        operators to compare different types of expressions.</p>

                the object. </p>

      <h5>Boolean Operators</h5>

      <p>Boolean operators AND (&amp;&amp;), OR (||) and NOT (!) take Boolean expressions as operands. Java uses the symbols &amp;&amp;, || and ! for the Boolean operators. By
        combining comparison
        operators with Boolean operators, you can make more complex conditions. For example, suppose you want to determine whether your final mark is greater than 90 AND your
        midterm mark is greater than 70. In Java you would write the expression this way:
        <pre>finalMark > 90 && midtermMark > 70</pre>
      </p>

      <p>In another example, suppose you wanted to determine whether the midterm level is a 4 OR the final level is a 4. If either the midterm level or the final level equals 4,
        the condition is True. In Java, you can write the expression like this:
        <pre>midtermLevel == 4 || finalLevel == 4</pre>
      </p>

      <p>The table below summarizes the three Boolean operators, and provides their truth table (a table showing all the possible inputs & outputs for that operator.) For each
        truth table, X and Y are boolean variables.</p>

      <p>The Boolean AND operator is very helpful for verifying that a given number is <strong>between</strong> two other numbers.</p>

      <p>Say you want to check if a number is between 80 and 100. This will be true if the number is above 80 AND below 100. Use Boolean and comparison operators as follows:
        <pre>number > 80 && number < 100</pre>
        This expression will return true when number is between 80 and 100, and false otherwise.</p>


      <p>Similar to arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), Boolean operators have a recognized order of operations. If you required the operations to be evaluated in a different
        order, use parentheses to change the operator precedence.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>NOT (!) is evaluated first</li>
        <li>AND (&amp;&amp;) is evaluated next</li>
        <li>OR (||) is evaluated last</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>The Else-If Statement</h4>

      <p>Suppose you wanted to choose from a set of alternatives and not from just two alternatives. An else-if statement could handle the choices.</p>

      <p>The syntax of an else-if statement is:</p>

      <pre>
    if ( &lt;<em>condition #1</em>&gt; ) {
        &lt;<em>statements #1</em>&gt;
    } else if ( &lt;<em>condition #2</em>&gt; ) {
        &lt;<em>statements #2</em>&gt;
    } else {
        &lt;<em>statements #3</em>&gt;
    }</pre>

      <p>Each condition must produce a Boolean result. The <strong>FIRST</strong> condition to evaluate to <strong>true</strong> will cause its block of code to execute. If none of
        the conditions evaluate to true, the code in the else block is execute.</p>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 4: Else-If Statement</h4>
      <pre class="code">
    if (guess == SECRET_NUM) {		//correct
        Console.print(&quot;You guessed it!&quot;);
    } else if (guess &lt; SECRET_NUM) {	//too low
        Console.print(&quot;Too low.&quot;);
    } else {				//too high
        Console.print(&quot;Too high.&quot;);
    }</pre>

      <p>Note that if a condition is true then only the statements with that condition are executed. None of the other conditions are tested or executed. This is important to keep
        in mind while choosing the order in which to create your condition statements! The order of your expressions is important because it can affect what statements are
        executed.</p>

      <h4>Nested If Statements</h4>

      <p>A nested if statement refers to an if statement inside another one. In the example below, The only way the <strong>homeroom == 100</strong> condition is evaluated is if
        gradeLevel is equal to 10, otherwise it is completely skipped. If gradeLevel is equal to 10,
        then the program will evaluate the code inside this statement.</p>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 5: Nested If Statement</h4>
      <pre class="code">
    if (gradeLevel == 10) {
        if (homeroom == 100) {
            Console.print(&quot;You are in Homeroom 100.&quot;);
        } else {
            Console.print(&quot;Your Homeroom is not listed in Grade 10.&quot;);

        <ul>
          <li>The initialization is executed <strong>once</strong></li>
          <li>Used to set the value of the counter</li>
          <li>Usually used to declare the counter variable as well</li>
          <li>Example:
            <pre>int i = 0;</pre>
          </li>

        <li><strong>Increment</strong></li>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>This can also be written as:

      <p>A <strong>sentinel</strong> value is a special value that acts as a flag to signify that a condition has been met.&nbsp; Sentinel values are often stored in
        constants. Sentinels are used in several program structures including if and loops structures.</p>

      <p>The following example demonstrates the use of <b>counters, accumulators and sentinels</b>. </p>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 9: The Average Calculator Program</h4>

        do this, the program will have to keep track of the number of values entered.</p>

          <li>Cars from an auto manufacturing plant need to be recalled. Model numbers 119, 179, 189 through 195 (inclusive) and 221 have been found to be defective because their
            wheels are not perfectly round. Create a <b>CarRecall</b> program that allows the mechanic to repeatedly enter in model numbers and be told whether the car is defective
            or not. The mechanic can stop the application any time by entering a -1.</li>
