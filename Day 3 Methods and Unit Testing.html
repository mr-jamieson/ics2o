      <h4>Methods</h4>

      <p>In programming, a larger program can often be divided up into smaller parts. We call these smaller parts subprograms, or in Java, we use the term <b>methods</b>.
        These smaller parts can be combined to solve the larger problem.</p>

      <p>There are many benefits to writing programs using methods:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>They allow the programmer to break a large problem into smaller parts, making it easier to solve</li>
        <li>They allow the programmer to save time by reusing code. Any time the particular task needs to be completed, the method can be called, instead of repeating the code all
          over again</li>
        <li>They keep programs very well organized, and accomplish each task within small blocks of code</li>
        <li>They can be tested using automated unit tests</li>
      </ol>

      <p><u>Definition</u>: A <b>Java method</b> is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation. When you call the Console.print()
        method, for example, the system actually executes several statements in order to display a message on the console.</p>

      <p>You have already been <em>using</em> methods (Console.print(), Console.readInt(), etc ...), this activity will help you learn how to <em>create</em> methods as well!</p>

      <p>A method consists of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A declaration (also called a header or signature): optional modifiers, return type, name and parameters (if any)</li>
        <li>A body: statements that implement the method</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The general form of a method is:</p>

      <pre>
&lt;optional_modifiers&gt; &lt;return_type&gt; &lt;name&gt;(&lt;parameters&gt;) {
    &lt;statements&gt;
}
</pre>

      <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 1: A simple method - sayHello()</h4>

      <p>Below is a very simple example of a method. Note that this method has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <b>public</b> modifier to control access level</li>
        <li>the <b>static</b> modifier to create a class method</li>
        <li>a <b>void</b> return type (meaning that the method does not contain the keyword <b>return</b>, thus it does not return a value)</li>
        <li><b>no</b> parameters (their brackets are empty)</li>
      </ul>

      <pre class="code">package activity3;
import simpleIO.Console;

public class MethodsExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sayHello();
    }

    public static void sayHello() {
        Console.print("Hello World");
    }

}</pre>

      <table class="didyouknow">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th><img src="../resources/images/tips.gif" alt="Did you know icon" title="Did you know icon" /></th>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Methods must belong to a class and need a descriptive name, that should be a verb (action word) such as findRadius() or sayHello()</li>
                <li>When calling a method, ALWAYS use brackets after the method name: <tt>sayHello<b>()</b></tt></li>
                <li>For today, all your method headers will contain the <b>static</b> modifier; this makes it a class method, instead of an instance method. We will learn more
                  about this later!</li>
                <li>Since Java is a compiled language, it does not matter what order you write your methods in, or whether they appear above or below the main method.</li>
              </ul>

      <h4>Passing Data to a Method - Parameters and Arguments</h4>

      <p>When you create a method, you can have it receive any kind of value you want, such as <tt>String</tt>, <tt>int</tt> or even objects (ADTs). Sending data to a method is
        known as <strong>passing data</strong>.</p>

      <p>In order to transfer the data you need to:<p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li><em>pass the data</em> to the method, and</li>
            <li><em>catch the data</em> in the method</li>
          </ol>
          <p>When the data is passed to the method, we refer to it as a <strong>parameter</strong>, and when the data is caught in the method, we refer to it as an
            <strong>argument</strong>.</p>

          <h5>Passing the Data</h5>

                <td>
                  <p>Data is passed to a method in the statement that calls it. You may have noticed that when calling a method, you must include brackets at the end of the
                    statement. These brackets hold parameters that you can send to the method.</p>

                  <p>You can send any kind of data (int, float, String, boolean) this way. The data can be a literal statement or a value contained in a variable.</p>

                  <p>The variables are placed in brackets after the method&#39;s name. The code takes the form:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <li>The order of your parameters and arguments is important; the order must match both in type and intent.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>However, argument names do <b>not</b> need to match parameter names</li>

}</pre>

          <p>Note that the <b>method call</b> passes three <b>parameters</b>: the integers 2, 3 and 10. <br />The <b>method header</b> identifies that

          <p>The next example shows a possible implementation of drawing right triangle using a single character. </p>
          <p>There are two versions of the method <tt>drawBar()</tt>, one that which accepts a <b>parameter <tt>i</tt></b> into the <b>argument <tt>length</tt></b>, the other that
            also
            accepts a <b>parameter <tt>'#'</tt></b> into the <b>argument <tt>symbol</tt></b>.</p>
          <p> Since the method call is inside a <b>for loop</b>, the first part will make a total of 5 calls to the method <tt>drawBar(int)</tt>, each printing one more asterisk
            than
            the last one. The second part will make 10 calls to the method <tt>drawBar(int, char)</tt>.</p>

          <h4>Program Testing</h4>

          <p>It is important that a programmer validate his/her program using a full range of test cases before it is implemented. This means that when you are testing
            your program you should try and see how it will react to a variety of input values and ensure that the results you receive are correct. When creating test cases, you
            should include both regular inputs, as well as inputs that might cause potential problems in the program.</p>

          <p>To manually test a program can be very time consuming, so it can be helpful to use an automated testing strategy to simplify the process. In this activity we
            will be learning about the JUnit automated testing framework that is used by many programmers to automate their testing.</p>

          <p>In order for automated testing to be useful, you must use <strong>functions</strong> in your programs. The JUnit framework is used for testing methods, but
            it is not meant for testing the main() method. Recall the general model for designing computer programs: Input - Processing - Storage - Output. Ideally, your methods
            will contain the Processing portion of your program, while the main method, using the Console class, will handle the Input &amp; Output. This setup will allow you to
            make use of automated testing.</p>

          <h4>Creating Automated Tests</h4>

          <p>To create a Junit test, it is considered best practice to use the name of the class that you are testing, followed by the keyword "Test". In this course, all classes
            that end with the letters "Test" are considered JUnit tests!</p>

          <p>So, if we wanted to create a JUnit test for the CubeCalculator program above, we would name it <b>CubeCalculatorTest.java</b></p>

          <p>Once your JUnit Class is created, you will need to populate it with test cases. For each test case, you must decide what input you will use, as well as the output that
            you
            expect to receive. Then call the <strong>assertEquals(expected, actual)</strong> method provided by the JUnit framework.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>expected</strong> parameter should be the output that your method should provide (this can be a String, int, double, boolean, etc)</li>
            <li>The <strong>actual</strong> parameter should include a call to the method under test (don't forget to include the class name) with the inputs that should produce
              the
              output identified in the previous step</li>
            <li>When testing methods that return <b><tt>double</tt></b> values, a <b>delta</b> parameter is needed. This is the maximum difference between <b>expected</b> and
              <b>actual</b> for which both numbers are still considered equal</li>
          </ul>

          <h4><img alt="Example Icon" class="icon" src="../resources/images/example.gif" /> Example 7: JUnit Test for CubeCalculator</h4>

          <p>The following is a simple automated test for the RectangleCalculator class. Notice that each test scenario (normal behaviour, one input is zero, one input is negative)
            is placed in its own method, with one or more test cases per method. Also the annotation <strong>"@Test"</strong> must be placed prior to each method so JUnit knows how
            to run it
            correctly.</p>

          <pre class="code">package activity3;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class CubeCalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testNormalScenario() {
        assertEquals(125, CubeCalculator.cubeOf(5));
        assertEquals(8, CubeCalculator.cubeOf(2));
        assertEquals(1, CubeCalculator.cubeOf(1));
    }

    @Test
    public void testZeroValues() {
        assertEquals(0, CubeCalculator.cubeOf(0));
    }

    @Test
    public void testNegativeValues() {
        assertEquals(-8, CubeCalculator.cubeOf(-2));
    }

}</pre>

          <p>There are two options for running JUnit tests. The first involves using the JUnit Console Standalone program, provided in your Repl.it. The other option involves
            manually editing the TestRunner.java program found in your test folder. Your teacher will demonstrate both! </p>

                <td>
                  <p>Why is the extra parameter needed when testing methods that return doubles? This is due to the lack of precision in storing double variables, which you may
                    have
                    already noticed in some of your programs.</p>
                  <p>Usually, the delta argument is a small number that represents the allowable rounding error.</p>
                  <p>For example, suppose we had a method called <tt>calculatePay(int hours, double rate)</tt> in an <tt>Employee</tt> class, which accepts the number of hours
                    worked
                    and the hourly rate, and returns the total pay. The assert statement to test that method could be:</p>
                  <pre class=code>assertEquals(112.50, Employee.calculatePay(15, 7.50), 0.005);</pre>
                  <p>This delta value of 0.005 would allow for rounding (up or down) to the nearest hundredth (2 decimal places of accuracy).

            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>When creating your tests, consider the following suggestions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Test typical values (values you expect the user will enter)</li>
            <li>Test very large, very small, and both negative and positive values.</li>
            <li>Test boundary conditions using the extremes of your input domain (maximum, minimum, just inside or outside the boundary)</li>
            <li>Test all of the branches of your decision structures</li>
            <li>Test repetition structures for typical and large numbers of iterations, as well as zero iterations</li>
            <li>Test conditions that should generate an error.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Finally, it's important to realize that not all programs can be testing only with automated tests (there will still be a need for some manual testing!), but they are a
            great asset for designing robust programs. Many programmers adopt a "test-driven development" programming style, where the programmer creates their automated tests
            before creating their programs. That way they know when their program is complete; it passes all the test cases!</p>

          <h4>The Math Class</h4>

          <p>The word "computer" traces its origin back to the 17th century, meaning "one who calculates, a reckoner, one whose occupation is to make arithmetical calculations"
            (source: <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/computer" target="_blank">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>.) The early computers were large calculating machines.
            Computers make mathematical calculations vastly simpler and quicker than performing the same calculations by hand.</p>

          <p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html" target="_blank">Math class</a> contains methods and constants for common

          <ul>
            <li>Math.PI &asymp; 3.141592653589793 (ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter)</li>

                In Canada, federal income tax is calculated differently depending on the amount of taxable income that you have earned.
                <blockquote>The rates for 2021 are as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>15% on the first $49,020 of taxable income, plus</li>

                  <li><strong>public static int levelToGrade(String level)</strong> - this method accepts a String representing a student's level of achievement and returns an int
                    corresponding to a 'pegged' percentage grade. The 'pegged' percentage should represent the midpoint of the grade range, rounded up to the nearest integer if
                    needed. If an invalid String is entered, it should return -1.</li>
